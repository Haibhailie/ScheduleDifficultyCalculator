# CMPT383 Project

This Repository contains the Final Project for CMPT383 - Summer 2021 course.
Topic Idea: MySchedule difficulty calculator (based on results from RateMyProf, Course diggers and an algorithm I'll make myself)
It will display approximate workload per week per course
It will display a difficulty score out of 100 (with 100 being a standard like 6 400 level courses).
The three programming languages I will use:

Java: The backend of the program will be running on Java, processing, algorithms, DTOs, APIs will be handled using Spring boot.
Python: The scripting language. I will use python to run scripts to perform operations in the backend when necessary.
React with Typescript: This will handle the frontend of the application, making API calls to the backend server and manage jsons being passed between them.
