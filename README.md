# CMPT383 Project - MySchedule Difficulty Calculator

**Project Specification:**
------ 
```
Based on results from RateMyProf, Course diggers and an algorithm I'll make myself  
It will display approximate workload per week per course  
It will display a difficulty score out of 100 (with 100 being a pre-defined standard like 6 400 level courses).
```
  

**Languages:**
------

1. **Java:** The backend of the program will be running on Java:
```
    1.  Data Collection with web scraping
    2. Algorithm to calculate
    3. Passing DTOs within different services
    4. API calls and server hosting will be handled with Spring boot
```

2. **Python:** The scripting language:
```
    1. Scripts to perform operations in the backend when necessary
```

3. **React with Typescript:**
```
    1. Frontend part of application
    2. Make API calls and fetch JSON data from backend
    3. Parse and Handle the given JSON and display them in a reasonable manner
```

**Exercise 7 Run Instructions:**
------
Please run
`
docker-compose up 
`
from the root of the repository.  
   
I have created the Hello.java in the same structure that will be used for the project.  
Hence, had to modify the dockerfile to reflect the packages that were being used.
